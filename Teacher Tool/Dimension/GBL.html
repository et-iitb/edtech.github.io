            <li>Immersive game or role-playing game: learners can choose their role i.e. have control over their avatars (in terms of appearance, actions etc.). Learners can select a role from pre-created roles or create a role based on a template.</li>
            <li>Tutorial based game or drill-and-practice games: there is scope to practice more than once and the same type of skills are getting assessed.</li>
