            <br><br>Check whether:<br>
            <ul><li>Personalised motivation: The motivational features change based on the student's response and performance. Example, the motivational message is different for a case where the student makes the first error from the time when the student has consistently provided wrong responses.</li>
            <li>Personalised scaffolds (hints/ prompts/ support): The point to check is that the hints vary based on the attempt of the student and are not the same across all the options.</li>
            <li>Personalised feedback: The students are given personalised feedback based on their past errors and/or performances.</li>
            </ul>Note: choose‘Completely incorporated’ if personalisation is seen in at least 2 out of 3 features. Mark as ‘Partially incorporated’ if 1 out of the 3 is seen and mark as not at all incorporated otherwise (0/ 3).  </td>

              <td>Check if the content adjusts to the student's profile, performance, interaction?
                <ul>
                <li>Profile: There is a diagnostic test at the beginning when the student engages with the content for the first time or at the beginning of every grade, or at the beginning of their learning journey. The product suggests content to the student based on the performance of the student in the test.</li>
                  <li>Performance: This includes adaptation based on students' response to the assessment questions.</li>
                  <li>Interaction: Adaptation is done based on student actions and behaviours such as time spent on each question, skipping content, requesting hints/help, random clicking pattern for answering and so on.</li>
                  </ul>Note: Choose ‘completely incorporated’ if at least 2 out of 3 adaptation is seen. Mark as partially incorporated if 1 out of the 3 adaptation is seen and mark as not at all incorporated otherwise (0 out of 3). It take time to observe adaptivity. 
                  Adaptivity based on interaction might not be easily apparent at the front end. Please consider your backend design as well, if needed, and provide rationale and evidence accordingly.
